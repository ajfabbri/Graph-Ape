***** Graph Ape

A simple GUI app, written in Java, which displays and generates graphs.

I created this as a platform to play around with graph drawing algorithms, which
can get quite interesting and involved.  Wrote this on the way back from a long
road trip.

***** Some things to try.

Click to create vertices.  Click on a vertex to highlight it and to unhighlight
it.

When a vertex is highlighted, clicking on another allows you to create an edge.

When a vertex is highlighted, pressing the Delete key will remove it.

A tree generation algorithm is available in the Generate menu.

Save and Load Graph functions are not yet implemented.
